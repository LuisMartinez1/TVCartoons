# TVCartoons

This is a project where you can watch cartoons from the 80s, 90s, and 2000s, based on the website LACartoons (you can visit it [here](https://www.lacartoons.com/)). We've created a simple random video player with the design of an old television, complete with a tuner reminiscent of those years.

## Demo: [TVCartoons](http://tvcartoons.somee.com/)

When you enter the site, you'll be greeted by a TV screen. You can watch it on your mobile in portrait mode, on an iPad, or on a PC without any issues; however, there is a minor CSS bug. You can change the channels, but please note that it might take a moment to find a playable episode, as some of them have been removed. The player will continue looping until it finds a playable episode.

Enjoy your nostalgic trip down memory lane!
